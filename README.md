# 🚦     Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify traffic signs from images. It's built in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on the GTSRB dataset.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a deep learning model that accurately classifies traffic signs, aiding in intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving.

---

## 🧠 Approach

- Preprocessed the image dataset (resizing, normalization, and one-hot encoding of labels).
- Designed and trained a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras to identify features of traffic signs.
- Used the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset for model training and evaluation.

---

## 📊 Results

- Achieved high accuracy in classifying over 40 types of traffic signs.
- Model generalizes well on unseen traffic sign images.

---

## 📁 Dataset

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy & Matplotlib

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add real-time sign detection using webcam input and OpenCV  
- Expand to multilingual or region-specific signs  
- Improve robustness against poor lighting or occlusion
